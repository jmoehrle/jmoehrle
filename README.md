### 👋 Hey there, I'm Jakob!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a **Physics master student** at **Heidelberg University** in Germany. I'm currently finishing my master's thesis at the **Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)** on the evolution of **turbulende strenght** and the **stellar and baryonic mass fractions** in **galaxies** across cosmic time.  
Check out my [📄 CV (PDF)](CV_Jakob_Moehrle.pdf), [📄 bachelor's thesis (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uZ9qICdc810_Rubrk45-UtCiBaQ_23Nn/view?usp=drive_link), preliminary [📄 master's thesis (PDF)], and code I wrote for spectral and photometric analysis of galaxies using JWST NIRSpec as well as NIRCam data.
