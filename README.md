### 👋 Hey there, I'm Jakob!

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a **Physics master student** at **Heidelberg University** in Germany. I'm currently finishing my master's thesis at the **Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)**, studying how **turbulence strength** and **stellar and baryonic mass fractions** in **galaxies** evolved across cosmic time.  
Check out my [📄 CV (PDF)](CV_Jakob_Moehrle.pdf), [📄 bachelor's thesis (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uZ9qICdc810_Rubrk45-UtCiBaQ_23Nn/view?usp=drive_link), preliminary [📄 master's thesis (PDF)], and code I wrote for [spectral](../emission_line_fitting) and photometric analysis of galaxies using JWST NIRSpec as well as NIRCam data.

### 🌍 Outside of my research

When I'm not working with galaxies, I enjoy playing and watching football⚽, going for a run🏃‍♂️, and cooking or baking🍳 .  
I'm also passionate about observing the nightsky on my own (if the weather allows!😬🌧️).
